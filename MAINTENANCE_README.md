# Maintenance Page Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the maintenance page functionality for the Dwell Ops property management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `MaintenanceRequest` model to Prisma schema
- Included enums for maintenance type, priority, and status
- Created relationships between maintenance requests, units, tenants, and assigned workers

### 2. Maintenance Types
- **ELECTRIC_SHORTAGE**: Power outages and electrical issues
- **WATER_LEAKAGE**: Leaking pipes, faucets, and water damage
- **PLUMBING**: General plumbing issues
- **HVAC**: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning problems
- **APPLIANCES**: Appliance malfunctions
- **STRUCTURAL**: Building structural issues
- **PEST_CONTROL**: Pest and rodent problems
- **GENERAL**: General maintenance requests
- **OTHER**: Any other maintenance issues

### 3. Priority Levels
- **LOW**: Non-urgent issues
- **MEDIUM**: Standard priority issues
- **HIGH**: Important issues requiring attention
- **URGENT**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention

### 4. Status Management
- **OPEN**: New requests awaiting assignment
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Requests currently being worked on
- **COMPLETED**: Finished requests
- **CANCELLED**: Cancelled requests

### 5. User Interface Components

#### Main Maintenance Page
- List view of all maintenance requests
- Summary statistics cards (Open, In Progress, Urgent, Unassigned)
- Comprehensive filtering system
- Priority-based sorting

#### Filtering System
- **Search**: Text search across titles, tenant names, properties, and units
- **Type Filter**: Filter by maintenance type
- **Status Filter**: Filter by request status  
- **Priority Filter**: Filter by priority level

#### Maintenance Request Detail Modal
- Complete request information display
- Status and assignment management
- Comments system
- Worker assignment functionality

### 6. File Structure

```
app/(protected)/maintenance/
├── page.tsx                 # Main maintenance page

components/maintenance/
├── maintenance-requests-list.tsx    # List component with filtering
├── maintenance-request-detail.tsx   # Detail modal component

lib/db/
├── maintenance.ts          # Database operations for maintenance requests

types/
├── maintenance.ts          # TypeScript types and enums

schemas/
├── index.ts               # Zod validation schemas
```

### 7. Key Features

#### Filtering and Search
- Real-time filtering without page refresh
- Multiple filter criteria can be applied simultaneously
- Text search across multiple fields

#### Request Management
- View detailed information for each request
- Update status and priority
- Assign maintenance workers (fundis)
- Add comments and updates

#### Priority-based Display
- Requests sorted by priority (Urgent → High → Medium → Low)
- Color-coded priority badges
- Summary statistics for quick overview

### 8. Database Migration Required

Before using this functionality in production, run the following:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

This will create the necessary database tables and generate the Prisma client.

### 9. Integration with Sidebar

The maintenance page is already connected to the sidebar menu at `/maintenance`. The sidebar includes all necessary routes:

- Dashboard
- Maintenance (newly added)
- Tenants
- Properties
- Leases
- Payments
- Reports
- Settings

### 10. Demo Page

A demo version is available at `/maintenance-demo` that showcases the complete functionality with mock data, allowing testing without database setup.

2. **Detail Modal**: Shows the maintenance request detail view with update capabilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **File Attachments**: Allow tenants and workers to attach photos
3. **Notification System**: Email/SMS notifications for status changes
4. **Mobile App Integration**: API endpoints for mobile applications
5. **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics and reporting for maintenance trends
6. **Workflow Management**: Advanced workflow rules and automation
